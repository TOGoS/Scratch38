** Branch naming convention

~lowercase subproject name + "/bare/" + branch name~

e.g. ~s0004/bare/master~.

"bare" is to distinguish 'bare' branches, i.e. those
that include *only* the sub-project's sub-directory
(i.e. things that could be pulled in as subtrees, if at all),
from regular branches of the main project.

This might not be the best convention.
Maybe something like ~subtrees/s38-s0004/master~
would be more obvious, idk.
