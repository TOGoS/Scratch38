# Deno Web Starter Project

2024-12-31

Idea here is to provide a barebones
structure for generating a JavaScript
(frontend-only) web application using Deno
as the compiler.

Goals:
- Small and simple as possible
  - Can use TDBuilder
- Can load page via filesystem
- Make it simple to load over HTTPS in order
  to use some web APIs that dumbly require that
